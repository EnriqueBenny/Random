# Renown Trade Efficiency
In Fire Emblem Three Houses, Renown is a rare and important currency used to perchase special buffs and obtain
rare items. With the use of the Ashen Wolves DLC's Pagan Altar, it is possible to get a lot of renown fast, but
this program exists to answer the question of "Which Trade is the Most Efficient?" The information is returned to the
user via tkinter, and the items are grouped based on the stocks available in the eastern and western merchants, who appear
several months into the game.
